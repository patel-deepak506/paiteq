There are several options to achieve this communication, 
each with its own set of pros and cons. The choice of the best option depends on various factors, 
including the specific use case, system architecture,
and requirements. Here are some common options for service communication


1. There are some option I am going to mention .
    i- http/https
    ii- grpc
    iii- messaging queue

2. There are some pros and cons all the options.
  i- pros=> Widely supported and well-understood protocol.
    Platform-agnostic, meaning ServiceA and ServiceB can be built using different technologies.
    Good for request-response interactions.

    cons=> Can be less efficient for real-time or streaming data.
            Overhead of HTTP headers.
    ii- pros=> Asynchronous communication, decoupling services in time.
                Highly scalable and fault-tolerant.
    cons => Complex setup and configuration.
            Messages may be processed out of order in some scenarios.

    iii- Pros=> 
            Efficient and high-performance with Protocol Buffers.
            Supports streaming and bidirectional communication
        cons=> May have a steeper learning curve for teams unfamiliar with gRPC

3. best fits => 
    i- Suitable for most use cases, especially when you need to expose APIs for external or internal consumption.
    ii- Ideal for event-driven architectures and scenarios where one service needs to notify others without immediate response requirements
    iii- Suited for microservices with high-performance and real-time requirements
